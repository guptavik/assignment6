- We discussed 4 Cognitive Layers today: Perception (LLM), Memory, Decision-Making, and Action. 
- Your goal is to first create 4 different files (modules) for each one of these. 
- Then in your main.py configure the whole agent. 
- Then re-do the last assignment.
- Twist: whatever you're building, you need to ask the user about his preference "before" your agentic flow starts. This can be his  likes, location, taste, favorite topics, etc. (would be related to your extension idea). Then you need to feed this as part of the prompt. 
- You MUST make sure that your final system_prompt clears this prompt test Download prompt test.
- You're submitting:
    GitHub Link for me to see the code needs to have a beautiful, well-documented README.md (0 points of this file is not there)
    YouTube video link demonstrating your Extension.
